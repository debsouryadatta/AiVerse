## Steps of dev:
1. Initialise nextjs project, install shadcn, 
2. Setting up prisma, Setting up nextauth -> All from docs & taking help from bidsage project
3. Using Acceternity ui kit for design
4. pnpm add next-themes, designing the Navbar, Designing the Create Course page
5. Writing the code for generating the course, usng langchainjs with groq api for generation
6. Also using Youtube Api and the Unsplaash api for fetching the yt video and the image(Taking reference from the previous project)
7. Designing the Gallery page
8. Designing the Course page
9. Course page functionality - taking the slug from the route, if slug.length=1(show course details), else if slug.length>1(show the chapter component)

10. Feature: Social Media Feature

- Save course feature - Adding bookmarks table

11. Export as pdf feature:
- Show the whole course content in a single page, with the option to export as pdf
- pnpm install html2pdf.js

12. Issue in `pnpm run build` due to langchain library version mismatch, solved it by adding experimental: {serverComponentsExternalPackages: [ '@langchain/core', '@langchain/groq' ]}, into the next config file
13. Function Timeout only - 10Sec in free tier of Vercel, so had to switch to Render.com
14. Render.com next auth error -> Fixed by adding `trustHost: true` in the nextauth config and also adding forcedBaseUrl in the redirect of the nextauth config

15. Creating the Landing page of the website using aceternity components - Spotlight, cards section, Magic-button, flip-words, etc
