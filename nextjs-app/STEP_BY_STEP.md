- Create /api/stripe/route.ts -> for creating the stripe session & sending the stripe url when the api gets called from the frontend
- Create /api/webhook/route.ts -> for handling the stripe webhook events and creating the userSubscription row in the database accordingly
-  Install stripe cli from https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli , go to webhooks section on the dashboard and follow the steps
