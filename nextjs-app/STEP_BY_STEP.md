### Stripe Implementation:
- `pnpm i stripe`
- Create a stripe client inside the lib folder
- Create /api/stripe/route.ts -> for creating the stripe session & sending the stripe url when the api gets called from the frontend
- Create /api/webhook/route.ts -> for handling the stripe webhook events and creating the userSubscription row in the database accordingly
-  Install stripe cli from https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli , go to webhooks section on the dashboard and follow the steps

There is some problem in the voice mentors page, idk why prisma fetches data even though userId is null or it might be the nature of prisma to fetch all posts when userId is null?
